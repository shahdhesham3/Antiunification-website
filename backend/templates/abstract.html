      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        Anti-unification is a generalization technique that finds the most specific common abstraction between two expressions. 
        This thesis explores its theoretical foundation in both first-order and higher-order logic and presents a user-friendly 
        visual tool that demonstrates the process interactively. The tool highlights structural similarities and differences, 
        handles algebraic expressions, and provides visual cues to enhance understanding. Limitations of the current implementation 
        are discussed, particularly in dealing with quantified expressions and higher-order terms. The study concludes by evaluating 
        the effectiveness of the tool in educational and research contexts.
